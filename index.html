    <h1>How to Use the PeacockTV App: Complete Setup & Streaming Guide</h1>

    <p>
        PeacockTV has quickly become one of the most popular streaming platforms for movies, TV shows, original series, sports,
        and live entertainment. Whether you're installing the app for the first time or trying to navigate the Peacock TV Account Login 
        process, this complete guide will walk you through everything you need to get started. From creating your profile and
        activating your device to streaming and troubleshooting, this guide covers all steps clearly and simply.
    </p>

    <h2>What Is PeacockTV?</h2>
    <p>
        PeacockTV is a digital streaming service that provides access to a wide collection of NBCUniversal movies and shows.
        It supports nearly all popular devices including smart TVs, Android phones, iPhones, tablets, streaming sticks, and
        gaming consoles. To get full access to the platform, users must complete the Peacock TV account login process, which
        allows them to sync their subscriptions and preferences across devices.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Download & Install the PeacockTV App</h2>
    <p>
        Before you sign in, you will need the PeacockTV app on your device. The installation process varies slightly depending
        on your device, but the steps are simple:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Open the app store on your device (Google Play Store, Apple App Store, Roku Store, or TV app store).</li>
        <li>Search for “PeacockTV”.</li>
        <li>Select the app and choose “Install”.</li>
        <li>Open the app once installation is complete to begin setup.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Create Your PeacockTV Account</h2>
    <p>
        If you don’t already have an account, you must create one before logging in. Creating an account allows you to save
        your watch history, manage subscriptions, and complete the Peacock TV account login across various devices.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Open the PeacockTV app or visit the official website.</li>
        <li>Choose “Sign Up”.</li>
        <li>Enter your name, email address, and create a password.</li>
        <li>Select your plan (free or premium tier).</li>
        <li>Complete registration and verify your email if required.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Peacock TV Account Login: Step-by-Step Guide</h2>
    <p>
        Logging into your Peacock account is essential to start streaming. Here’s how to complete the Peacock TV Account Login
        on any device:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open the PeacockTV app on your device.</li>
        <li>Go to the Login or Sign In page.</li>
        <li>Enter your registered email ID and password.</li>
        <li>Click the login button to access your streaming dashboard.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
        If you have previously logged in on another device, your preferences and watchlist will automatically sync after the
        PeacockTV login is completed.
    </p>

    <h2>How to Activate PeacockTV on a Smart TV or Streaming Device</h2>
    <p>
        Some smart TVs and streaming sticks ask for activation using a code instead of direct login. During this process,
        you will still use your Peacock TV account login credentials but on a different device such as a computer or tablet.
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open the PeacockTV app on your smart TV.</li>
        <li>Select “Activate” or “Sign In with Code”.</li>
        <li>A unique activation code will appear on the screen.</li>
        <li>On another device, open the official activation page.</li>
        <li>Enter the activation code and sign in using your PeacockTV login credentials.</li>
        <li>Your TV will refresh automatically, granting access to your account.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Troubleshooting Peacock TV Account Login Issues</h2>
    <p>
        If you are unable to sign in or experience issues during the Peacock TV account login process, consider the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Incorrect Email or Password:</strong> Double-check your login details and ensure caps lock is turned off.</li>
        <li><strong>Password Reset:</strong> If you forgot your password, use the “Forgot Password” option to reset it.</li>
        <li><strong>App Cache Issues:</strong> Try clearing your app cache or reinstalling the PeacockTV app.</li>
        <li><strong>Internet Connectivity:</strong> Make sure your device is connected to a stable internet connection.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Compatibility:</strong> Some older models may not support the latest PeacockTV app features.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Start Streaming on PeacockTV</h2>
    <p>
        Once you complete the Peacock TV account login and set up the app, you can immediately begin streaming. Browse through
        categories like movies, TV series, live TV, sports, and Peacock originals. You can create multiple profiles, adjust
        parental controls, add shows to your watchlist, and enjoy seamless streaming across devices.
    </p>

    <h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
        Using the PeacockTV app is simple once you understand the setup process. From downloading the app and completing your
        Peacock TV account login to activating devices and resolving errors, this guide helps ensure a smooth streaming
        experience. With the right setup, you can enjoy a wide range of entertainment anytime and anywhere.
